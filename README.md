## Welcome to Bingfeng Pi's home

### Basic info 
- üëã Hi, I'm Bingfeng Pi, my English name is Winter. I like this name:)
- üëÄ I have 6+ years experience with Blockchain. I'm interested in blockchain & distributed netowrk related technologies & projects, such as [Hyperledger Fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric), [Hyperledger Indy](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node), [Hyperledger Firefly](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly), IPFS etc. 
- You can get to know more about me with [my blogs](https://www.jianshu.com/u/e9bee1674dac). 
- If you're intrested with me, please contact me with pi.bingfeng at gmail.com


### Current learning
- üå± I'm learning an immutable database project, [immudb](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb). It keeps data's integrity with Merkle Tree proof and also provide proof verification for both KV data and also SQL data.
- üíûÔ∏è [Hyperledger Firefly](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly) is another project I'm trying to learning. With Firefly, it's easy to develop Dapps for Web3 or NFT, and also useful for testing of Fabric chaincode. 

### My education
- 2004/09-2007/04: [Huazhong University of Science & Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/), Master Degree
- 2000/09-2004/07: [Harbin Engineering University](http://www.hrbeu.edu.cn/), Bachelor Degree
